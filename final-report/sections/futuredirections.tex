    There are many future directions for work with Gr\"obner bases not limited to computational algebra. Fields such as robotics \cite{montes2002new}, error-correcting codes \cite{333885}, and cryptography \cite{faugere2003algebraic} are key areas of Gr\"obner basis research. Perhaps progress can also be made into solving the open problem of determining the minimum number of clues for a Sudoku puzzle to have a unique solution.
